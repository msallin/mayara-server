//! Blob detection for radar target tracking.
//!
//! This module detects contiguous groups of strong pixels (blobs) in radar spokes
//! and identifies those that meet ship size constraints. All blobs are sent to the
//! tracker which decides whether to track them based on:
//! - Guard zone presence (automatic acquisition)
//! - Existing tracked target proximity (continue tracking)
//! - MARPA (manual acquisition via user click)
//! - DopplerAutoTrack (automatic acquisition of Doppler-colored targets)
